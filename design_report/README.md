# The Design of EmoChat
*EmoChat is an APP designed for campus students where they can chat anonymously based on their emotions. From this report, you can follow up the flow of design with us.*  

## Introduction

EmoChat is an online chatting app based on emotions, it is designed for contemporary university students who often suffers from emotional fluctuation and internal loneliness. Users enter EmoChat and select their current emotions, using the platform provided by our app, students are free to chat with people who are experiencing the same emotion or just the opposite. We expect that through peer chatting and mutual comforting, negative emotions can be soon eliminated, lonely hearts can be soon warmed and positive emotions can be spread all across the campus.

## Feedback
In order to get to know the voice of end users, we held twice meetings with Group 1 to listen up their feedback to our product.
### First Meeting
The first meeting was held after we ideated our product and haven't started to build our paper prototype, so we can refine our project before the paper prototype was made.  
In this meeting, we briefly introduced our product to Group 1, and we mainly discussed the design and sketches of our product.  
Their feedback was:  
+ There are some privacy concerns when chatting to others.
+ EmoMap may disclose the location of users.
+ At the initial stage, there may be only a small group of students using this app. The UX in this period should be carefully considered.

From the critiques of group 1, we can conclude that privacy is still a big concern to users. Privacy is taken into consideration when we designed this app. However, we don’t provide enough signifiers to indicate this.  
After discussion, we refined the design of our app, and added more signifiers to let users feel their privacy is protected properly.  
Firstly, we decide to add a privacy notification page when users start this app for the first time. This page should not use long and dull legal terms. Instead, we use brief introductions with icons and illustrations to tell user their conversation will not be recorded, they have rights to not provide privacy data to us, and their data will not be leaked to others. Meanwhile, Users can set keywords before chatting. When keywords are involved in chatting, the system can warn users to avoid privacy disclosure.  
Secondly, We will ask for users’ permission before their location is shown in EmoChat. In the EmoMap, we will show a distribution diagram instead of a concrete map. We can use heat map to indicate the emotion distribution among campus, so individuals’ location will be protected while keeping the intention of this module.  
Thirdly, we can use some animation in the UI design as signifiers. For example, when the conversation is completed, we will display an animation, showing the content will be burnt or crushed into a ball. These signifiers will let users understand that their conversation will not be recorded.  
As for the UX in the initial stage, we can invite some friends to try our beta version and collect their feedbacks. Also, we can ask users to invite their classmates to join this app. Because our app focuses on campus scenario, we can start advertising and promotion from our campus at the initial stage. Therefore, the number of users will be guaranteed. Moreover, the chatting function will work with only a small group of users, so the lack of user shouldn't affect our UX.





### Second Meeting
After we built the paper prototype, we held the second meeting so they can evaluate our prototype.
